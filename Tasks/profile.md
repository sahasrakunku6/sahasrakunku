**Why do you want to join GDG FOSS Wing?**: 

I want to join FOSS Wing both to grow as a developer by collaborating on real projects and to support juniors by sharing what I’ve learned. Open source to me is not just about code—it’s about discussions, mentorship, and solving real-world problems together. Being part of FOSS Wing will let me learn from peers, guide juniors in areas like web development, AI/ML, and Git, and contribute to building a strong, supportive open-source community.

**Are you interested in participating in any of the global open-source programs like GSoC, LFX, Outreachy, SOB etc? If yes, mention it**: 

I am truly passionate about this opportunity. Participating in the Summer of Bitcoin (SOB) allowed me to experience the power of open-source collaboration and understand how global projects thrive. This transformative experience fueled my ambition to engage in programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Outreach and LFX. 

I aspire to contribute to repositories centered on backend development, Django, and web technologies, with a focus on impactful initiatives that uplift others. For me, these programs transcend mere coding; they represent a chance to foster meaningful change and empower my peers in the community.
